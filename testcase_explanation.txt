I have used recursion for solution and optimised using dynamic programming.
Greedy wont work as skip and recharge sequence matters so we find thee best path here

I used 0 based indexing in the code, and 1 based for explanation
Assumptions in the problem:
FOR K3,K7
if we kill at k3 or k7 and we do not skip at k4,k8 then level[k4] = level[k4] + (level[k3]+1)/2;// for 5 -> 3 will be added to next index
if we skip k3 or k4 everything works normally
with recharge original power gets restored

Test case1:

12   ->power
2    ->recharge
2    ->skip
3 4 5 10 2 3 5 10 2 5 3 ->levels

in this case,
3,4,5 will be defeated with initial power,
skip index 4(power 10), as 10 + (5+1)/2 needs to be defeated at this index, so i skip it,as k3 can attack only k4 from behind
Count skip=1,recharge=0 here
i recharge before fighting index 5,
i defeat k5,k6,k7 in one go,
recharge=1,skip=1
now i skip k8(as its power become 10+(5+1)/2, which can be defeated even after recharge)
recharge=1,skip=2

i recharge before fighting k9, and defeat k9,k10,k11 and come outside the chakravyuh
recharge=2,skip=2
This is the best scenario to escape in this test case


Test case 2:

12 ->power
2  ->recharge
1  ->skip
3 4 10 1 2 3 5 1 8 1 1 ->levels

in this case i defeat k1,k2
skip =0,recharge=0
then skip k3(will not attack from behind at k4 as its alive and will not regenerate)
skip =1,recharge=0
power 5 remaining here
 k4,k5defeated
 skip =1,recharge=0
 recharge before k6,
 defeat k6,k7,k8(k8+k7/2 )
 skip =1,recharge=1
 recharge last time 
 ddefeat k9,k10,k11 and escape
 skip =1,recharge=2,
